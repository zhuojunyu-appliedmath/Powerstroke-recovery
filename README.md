This repository holds code used to generate the figures and tables in our paper "Variational design of sensory feedback for powerstroke-recovery systems". Figures 2-8 are for the HCO model. Figures 10-16 are for the Markin model. The rest figures are not generated via simulation.

Fig. 2 shows a typical solution of the HCO-motor system. To generate figure, run Fig_2.m

Fig. 3 shows the trajectoreis on the same time scale and the iSRC solution. To generate figure, run Fig_3.m
